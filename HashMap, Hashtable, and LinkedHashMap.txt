ðŸ”¹ 1. Thread-Safety
HashMap is not thread-safe. It should be used in single-threaded applications or externally synchronized if needed.

Hashtable is thread-safe. All its methods are synchronized, making it slower in concurrent environments.

LinkedHashMap is also not thread-safe, just like HashMap.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Null Keys and Null Values
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.

Hashtable does not allow null keys or null values.

LinkedHashMap also allows one null key and multiple null values, just like HashMap.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Ordering of Entries
HashMap does not maintain any order (neither insertion nor access order).

Hashtable also does not maintain any order.

LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of entries. It can also be configured to maintain access order (useful for LRU cache).

ðŸ”¹ 4. Performance
HashMap is faster than Hashtable because it is unsynchronized.

Hashtable is slower due to synchronization overhead.

LinkedHashMap is slightly slower than HashMap because it maintains a doubly linked list for insertion/access order.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Use Case Recommendations
Use HashMap when you donâ€™t need order and are working in a single-threaded environment.

Avoid Hashtable in modern applications. If thread safety is needed, prefer ConcurrentHashMap.

Use LinkedHashMap when you need to maintain the insertion order or create LRU cache behavior.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Summary
HashMap = Fast, nulls allowed, no order, not thread-safe.

Hashtable = Legacy, synchronized, no nulls, slow.

LinkedHashMap = Maintains insertion/access order, nulls allowed, not thread-safe.
