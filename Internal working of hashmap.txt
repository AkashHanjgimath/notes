🔹 1. What is HashMap?
A key-value data structure in Java.

Provides constant-time (O(1)) performance on average for insert and retrieve operations.

Uses hashing internally for fast access.

🔹 2. Internal Data Structure
HashMap uses an array of Node<K, V> called table.

Each slot in the array is called a bucket.

🔸 What is a Node?
A Node is an internal class used to store a key-value pair along with the key’s hash and a pointer to the next Node (for handling collisions).

java
Copy
Edit
class Node<K,V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K,V> next;
}
👉 Purpose: Holds one key-value pair and links to the next node if multiple keys hash to the same bucket.

🔹 3. Step-by-Step put(K key, V value) Execution
✅ Step 1: Compute Hash
hashCode() of the key is calculated.

A better hash is derived by applying bit manipulation to reduce collisions.

✅ Step 2: Find Bucket Index
Index = (n - 1) & hash where n is the array length.

This gives the position in the array where the key-value should go.

✅ Step 3: Check Bucket
If table[index] is null, store the new node directly.

✅ Step 4: Handle Collision
If already a node exists at index:

Traverse the list.

If a node with the same key is found, update the value.

If key is not found, add new node at the end.

✅ Step 5: Treeify (if needed)
If number of nodes in a bucket ≥ TREEIFY_THRESHOLD (8), and table size ≥ 64, convert list to a Red-Black Tree for better performance.

✅ Step 6: Resize (if needed)
If size > capacity * loadFactor, resize (double the capacity) and rehash all entries.

🔹 4. Step-by-Step get(K key) Execution
✅ Step 1: Compute Hash
Same hashing method as put().

✅ Step 2: Find Bucket
Locate the correct index in the array using the hash.

✅ Step 3: Search Node
Traverse the bucket:

If list: check each node’s key using equals().

If tree: do binary search using key comparison.

Return the value if key matches, else return null.

🔹 5. Load Factor (Resize Threshold)
Default: 0.75 (75%)

Determines when to resize HashMap to maintain performance.

When size exceeds capacity * loadFactor, HashMap doubles the size and rehashes entries.

Rehashing is expensive (O(n)), so initial capacity should be estimated carefully.

🔹 6. Collision Handling
Multiple keys may hash to the same index (collision).

Handled using:

Linked List chaining (initially).

Red-Black Tree (Java 8+) if too many collisions occur (≥ 8).

🔹 7. Treeify Threshold
✅ Constants:
java
Copy
Edit
TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8
MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY = 64
✅ Conditions:
If bucket size ≥ 8 AND table capacity ≥ 64 → convert bucket’s list into Red-Black Tree.

If capacity < 64 → resize instead of treeify.

✅ Why Treeify?
List lookup is O(n), tree lookup is O(log n).

Prevents performance drop in worst-case scenarios.

🔹 8. Resize Mechanism
Triggered when size > capacity * loadFactor.

Steps:

New capacity = old capacity × 2.

All existing entries are rehashed and stored in new positions.

Costly operation — avoid frequent resizing by setting proper initial capacity.

🔹 9. Custom Key Usage
To use custom objects as keys in HashMap:

Must override hashCode() → for correct bucket placement.

Must override equals() → for correct key matching in collisions.

If not done → get() and put() may behave incorrectly.

🔹 10. Performance Overview
| Operation       | Best Case | Worst Case (pre Java 8) | Worst Case (Java 8+) |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| `put()`/`get()` | O(1)      | O(n) (linked list)      | O(log n) (tree)      |
| Resize          | O(n)      | O(n)                    | O(n)                 |



🔹 11. Constants Summary
java
Copy
Edit
DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY = 16
DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.75f
TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8
UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 6
MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY = 64

🔹 12. Visual Flow Summary

put(key, value)
 → compute hash
 → get index
 → insert new Node OR handle collision
 → check if treeify is needed
 → resize if needed

get(key)
 → compute hash
 → get index
 → search key in bucket (list/tree)
 → return value if found

✅ remove(key) in HashMap – Internal Working
🔹 Purpose:
Removes the key-value pair from the map if the key exists.

🔧 Step-by-Step Working of remove(key)
1️⃣ Calculate Hash

hashCode() of the key is called.

Then passed to internal hash() method for better distribution.

Example:
int hash = hash(key.hashCode());

2️⃣ Find Bucket Index

Index is calculated using:
int index = (n - 1) & hash; // where n = table.length

This gives the position in the internal array (table[]).

3️⃣ Search the Bucket

Get the first node in that index:
Node<K,V> first = table[index];

4️⃣ Traverse the Linked List or Tree

Loop through the linked list or Red-Black tree nodes at that index.

For each node:

Compare hash

Compare key using equals()

5️⃣ If Matching Node Found – Remove It

If node is the first: update table[index] = e.next;

If node is in middle or end: update prev.next = e.next;

6️⃣ If Bucket is a Tree (TreeNode)

Use TreeNode.removeTreeNode()

Unlinks node and rebalances Red-Black tree if needed.

7️⃣ Update size and modCount

size--

modCount++ → important for fail-fast iterators

8️⃣ Return Value

If key is found → return the value

If key is not found → return null

📌 Simplified Internal Code

java
Copy
Edit
Node<K,V> e = table[index];
Node<K,V> prev = null;

while (e != null) {
    if (e.hash == hash && (e.key.equals(key))) {
        if (prev == null)
            table[index] = e.next; // remove first node
        else
            prev.next = e.next;    // remove middle/end node
        size--;
        modCount++;
        return e.value;
    }
    prev = e;
    e = e.next;
}
return null;
🌳 If Bucket is a Tree

If the bucket is treeified:

Call removeTreeNode()

Adjust tree structure accordingly
